  "readme": "# Grunt Image Embed\n\nThis task converts all data found within a stylesheet (those within a url( ... ) declaration) into base64-encoded data URI strings. This includes images and fonts.\n\nCreated by Eric Hynds [@erichynds](http://twitter.com/erichynds) with major contributions from [dancingplatypus](https://github.com/dancingplatypus).\n\n## Features\n\n* Supports both local & remote images.\n* Ability to specify a size limit. Default is 32kb which is IE8's limit.\n* Existing data URIs will be ignored.\n* Skip specific images by specifying a directive comment.\n* Ability to purge images that have been encoded\n* Includes two helpers: `encode_stylesheet` to encode a stylesheet, and `encode_image` to encode an image.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall this plugin with the command:\n\n```js\ngrunt install grunt-image-embed\n```\n\nNext, add this line to your project's grunt file:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks(\"grunt-image-embed\");\n```\n\nLastly, add configuration settings to your grunt.js file (see below).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThis task has two required properties, `src` and `dest`. `src` is the path to your stylesheet and `dest` is the file this task will write to (relative to the grunt.js file). If this file already exists **it will be overwritten**.\n\nAn example configuration looks like this:\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  imageEmbed: {\n    dist: {\n      src: [ \"css/styles.css\" ],\n      dest: \"css/output.css\",\n      deleteAfterEncoding : false\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Optional Configuration Properties\n\nImageEmbed can be customized by specifying the following options:\n\n* `maxImageSize`: The maximum size of the base64 string in bytes. This defaults to `32768`, or IE8's limit. Set this to `0` to remove the limit and allow any size string.\n* `baseDir`: If you have absolute image paths in your stylesheet, the path specified in this option will be used as the base directory.\n* `deleteAfterEncoding`: Set this to true to delete images after they've been encoded. You'll want to do this in a staging area, and not in your source directories.  Be careful.\n\n### Skipping Images\n\nSpecify that an image should be skipped by adding the following comment directive *after* the image:\n\n```css\nbackground: url(image.gif); /*ImageEmbed:skip*/\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Eric Hynds (@erichynds)\nLicensed under the MIT License.\n",
